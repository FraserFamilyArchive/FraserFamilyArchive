## About the Collection

This archive includes photos, newspaper articles, stories, and documents on the history of the Fraser Family. It was built with the intention of making our history easily accessible to all family members.

It was created by Simon Phypers as a final project for their diploma in Library Information Technology. 

If you have any questions, noticed any errors, have items you wish to add to the archive, or just have a comment please reach out to me at simonphypers@gmail.com. 

I am particularly looking for information on fuller forms of names, scans of family trees, the identities of people in images tagged "unidentified persons," and anything else old you have.
