## About the Collection

This archive includes photos, newspaper articles, stories, and documents on the history of the Fraser Family. It was built with the intention of making our history easily accessible to all family members.

It was created by Simon Phypers as a final project for their diploma in Library Information Technology. 

If you have any questions, noticed any errors, or have items or stories you wish to add to the archive, please reach out to simonphypers@gmail.com.
